# Permit Bearings

**Check a California ADU, JADU, or SB 9 project. See the sources behind the
result. Take unresolved questions to staff.**

Permit Bearings is a prototype decision-support tool for California ADU, JADU,
and SB 9 projects. Structured applicant facts produce candidate routes,
relevant standards, cited official sources, and questions for local staff. The
matcher is deterministic. Separate English and Spanish explanations are
AI-assisted, review-pending drafts.

**Live demo: <https://chelseakr.github.io/permit-bearings/>** — the static
prototype in your browser, with no account and no tracking.

**Runtime AI (ADR 0004, owner-directed, 2026-08-21) — Prototype:** an
optional service, `permit_pathways.ai` (`make serve-ai`), adds AI at the
edges of the applicant path: natural-language intake that drafts the
matcher's own structured facts for the applicant to confirm, a plain-language
explanation whose every statement must cite a passage the service verifies
against the committed `corpus/` before display, and questions for local staff
drafted for this applicant. The deterministic matcher is unchanged and is
the only thing that produces a result. With the service absent, `check.html`
is the static experience it always was and makes no request beyond its
origin; with it running, the applicant turns the assistance on explicitly.
Decision, boundaries, and what is still pending are in
[`docs/adr/0004-runtime-ai-at-the-edges.md`](docs/adr/0004-runtime-ai-at-the-edges.md);
the data flow in `docs/DATA-FLOW.md`; the measured evaluation in
`evals/ai/`. Earlier statements that the project makes "no runtime external
model calls" now describe only the static site.

## Quickstart

Open `index.html` directly, or run
`python3 -m http.server 8765` and visit `http://localhost:8765/`. The landing,
applicant guide, packet sample, ordinance screen, and evidence page use
relative links and work without network requests. Only the four data-driven
pages load the generated `data/demo-data.js` bundle.

A separate bounded sample compares a made-up Woodland packet inventory with
25 source-bound items from one City preapproved ADU checklist. The City's
[official program page](https://www.cityofwoodland.gov/1616/Preapproved-ADU-Plan-Program),
checked 2026-08-09, says **“Preapproved ADU List: Coming soon!”** No listed
City plan was identified. The flagship is therefore a **source-bound
future-state simulation**, not a currently usable preapproved-plan workflow
or applicant-ready service. Two fabricated parcel values are bound to the
`CITY` and `LU_Descr` fields exposed by Yolo County's public parcel-layer
metadata; no address, APN, or live parcel is queried. The sample does not open
files, verify parcel facts, reproduce a complete local checklist, determine
final eligibility, certify submission completeness, or approve permits.

At build time, a versioned synthetic journey definition binds the existing
Woodland golden routing fixture to that readiness workflow and packet. The
generated, fingerprinted envelope is also the browser's fail-closed handoff
contract for these prototype inputs. A strict portable registry at
`data/workflows/registry.json` selects the workflow, packet, remedy, journey,
availability, and generated-output paths. It raw-byte-pins every canonical
input; generated destinations are path-bound and rebuilt before use. Build and
CLI code resolve those paths through stable IDs and explicit availability policies.
The Python boundary rejects ambiguous or oversized JSON, linked files,
cross-platform-unsafe paths, duplicate IDs, orphan files, shared paths,
fingerprint drift, and mismatched IDs. Bundle format 6 separately hashes the
exact raw registry against its generation receipt and validates every input
pin in the browser; browser code cannot inventory files absent from a bundle.
The registry contains one prototype workflow and names that same entry as the one
browser default; it is infrastructure for adding a reviewed workflow, not
evidence that multiple workflows are active. A separate strict availability record at
`data/availability/woodland-preapproved-adu-program.json` binds that contract
to the official program-page evidence and a date-bound recheck. The browser
blocks the handoff when that record is missing, malformed, or expired. Within
that simulation boundary, only the active, unedited made-up Woodland sample
can offer the packet step. The applicant must explicitly answer its remaining
workflow-applicability question; no answer is selected by default. A matching
**Yes** opens the versioned packet example, while **No** or **I'm not sure**
withholds it and preserves the relevant boundary or staff question. **Yes**
does not establish that a City plan is available.

On an exact, integrity-checked future-state simulation entry whose
availability record is still within its recheck period, the browser also
composes a print-focused summary from that envelope: the candidate route,
made-up facts, the three reported-missing preparation actions, staff
questions, source evidence, the prototype boundary, and the public journey
ID/version. The button opens the browser's print dialog, where a person may
choose Print or Save as PDF. The app does not create, upload, or store a file,
and direct, invalid, or unavailable packet entry withholds the summary with
the underlying findings.

**External evidence gate:** prepared, not run. The repository now binds future
content review, same-version sessions, manual access/language checks, a timed
maintenance rehearsal, and a qualifying partner step to explicit ledgers and
thresholds. No reviewer outcome, participant result, accessibility signoff,
Spanish semantic approval, completed rehearsal, or partner commitment is
claimed. Inspect the current status on the live **Sources & limits** page or in
[`data/validation/woodland-flagship-gate.json`](data/validation/woodland-flagship-gate.json).

**Beta operations package:** **PREPARED / NOT APPROVED**. A proposed ADR,
role-based runbook, portable control ledger, and strict validator now define a
pilot-neutral public/static boundary with no accounts, uploads,
application-managed applicant storage, browser persistence, application
telemetry, runtime external model calls, or permitting-system writeback. Every
deployment field, human approval, records rehearsal, and partner decision is
still null/`not_run`. That package describes the static-only deployment
shape; the optional AI service directed by ADR 0004 is outside it and has no
operations package yet. Static hosts and operational systems may separately
process request or operational metadata and require deployment-specific
review. See
[`docs/BETA-OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/BETA-OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK.md).

**Pilot-neutral beta aggregate gate:** **PREPARED / TESTED BETA NOT RUN**.
The strict read-only gate binds 12 existing specialized ledgers and artifacts
at fixed canonical paths by raw SHA-256, captures every direct and transitive
validator input in one private mutation-evident snapshot, inventories the
complete `data/` tree and exact rule-directory membership, pins every not-run
ledger byte, and validates dynamic source-state arrays through their strict
semantic loader. It rebuilds the registry-selected packet and journey from
canonical inputs, reconciles program availability and adopted source
dependencies, and recomputes current source/rule/reference currency plus all
14 beta exit categories as `not_run`.
Its committed schema has no passing, approval, or `proceed` state. The
Woodland reference remains a synthetic future-state prototype and cannot fill
the empty pilot scope. See
[`data/validation/pilot-beta-gate.json`](data/validation/pilot-beta-gate.json).

```

The review-worklist CLI returns `0` for a valid clear queue, `1` for a valid
queue with human work remaining, and `2` for invalid input or output. Neither
its worklist nor its separate decision ledger changes the adopted source state
or publishes anything. The deployment-smoke command returns only an
availability/artifact-shape result.

The source-release CLI validates three separate approval, publication, and
rollback receipt schemas. It loads the canonical workflow registry and binds
every registered readiness workflow, packet, remedy set, and journey by
default; it has no unregistered-path or single-workflow release mode. The
committed examples keep every evidence field
null and remain `not_run`. A generated prepared set binds the exact
changed-source snapshot, worklist, and complete decision-ledger fingerprints;
it still records no approval or execution. A completed approval requires every
exact work item to have a resolved evidence-bound disposition and separately
records one explicit digest-bound source resolution (`restore_recorded`,
`adopt_observed`, or `retain_hold`) for every changed source. Generic work-item
dispositions never imply source adoption. Publication and rollback then require
their own later receipt, exact upstream-receipt fingerprint, ordered UTC
timestamps, and a separately re-derived `reviewed` source-state snapshot.
Work-item decisions are date-only in this schema, so the approval check proves
calendar-date ordering but not intraday order. Receipt parsing opens one regular
file descriptor, is bounded, and rejects duplicate fields, non-finite values,
malformed URLs, non-UTF-8 data, symlinks, and oversized input. Preparation
exclusively creates a new output directory, durably writes each receipt, and
writes a durable completion marker last. Consumers must reject a package
without that marker. The CLI reports the approval outcome and source-hold
state; a rejection or retained hold is valid evidence but not a publishable
success. The validators never run or authenticate Git, inspect a live
deployment, authenticate opaque authority/evidence receipt IDs, adopt source
state, clear a hold, deploy, or roll back. Schema-v1 template fingerprints are
pinned in the validator and by regression tests; changing their schema-v1
semantics requires a new schema version. These templates are outside export
profiles v1 and v2 pending an explicit profile review.

The beta-operations validator returns `0` only when the exact pilot-neutral
planning package remains `prepared_not_approved`, every deployment and
records-execution field remains null/`not_run`, all nine role approvals remain
null/`not_run`, all 17 controls match the pinned contract, and the ADR/runbook
raw-byte SHA-256 bindings still match. Exit `0` is schema evidence only; it
cannot approve a beta,
deployment, partner decision, privacy/security posture, records workflow, or
legal compliance. A later execution or approval requires a separately
reviewed schema.

The pilot-beta aggregate CLI returns `0` only when the exact prepared record,
its canonical role paths and raw artifact digests, complete mutation-evident
input snapshot tree, independently pinned not-run ledgers, strict dynamic
schemas, specialized pending-state contracts, shared lock and
prototype identity, current source/rule/reference currency calculation, and
every derived `not_run` category agree. Its default record is resolved under
the selected repository root. It returns `2` for drift or attempted
promotion.
Exit `0` is aggregate integrity evidence only; it is not an active pilot,
tested beta, human review, deployment approval, partner decision, or external
validation result. Schema v1 cannot record any of those outcomes.

The evidence-export `build` command returns `0` only after its selected files
are verified against Git `HEAD`, packaged in the single canonical ZIP
representation, and checked against the pinned public/synthetic profile.
Archive-only `verify` and `restore` validate the recorded commit identifier,
profile, hashes, bytes, and canonical structure; they do not retrieve or
authenticate the originating Git commit. Both are inert and do not adopt,
approve, or publish records. The exact format, operator commands, privacy
boundary, and limitations are in
[docs/EXPORT-RESTORE.md](docs/EXPORT-RESTORE.md).

## Standards Conformance

The repository follows a pinned private portfolio standards baseline, fetched
and enforced by the `Standards` workflow in CI.
This table reports implemented automation separately from review work that
still needs a person.

| Standard | State and evidence |
|---|---|
| Responsible-Tech Framework | Applies — Product, privacy, source, AI-use, accessibility, and unresolved-review boundaries are recorded in `docs/PRODUCT-CONTEXT.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `PROVENANCE.md`, and `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`. |
| Code Quality | Applies — Python 3.12 and development dependencies are locked; Ruff, strict mypy, branch coverage, generated-data parity, and 29 golden cases run through `make verify`. Two separate coverage numbers, because they measure different things: **85% branch coverage of the `permit_pathways` package**, and **20% line / 17% function coverage of `assets/demo.js`**, the 5,255-line browser runtime that carries the second implementation of the rule logic. The browser floor is a ratchet on a file that had no coverage gate at all before; it is not equivalent to the Python figure and is not presented as one. Ruff, strict mypy, and Bandit now cover `src`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `demo` rather than `src` alone, and `make verify` refuses to run without Node instead of silently skipping the eight cross-runtime contract tests. Ruff enforces complexity 10 across the Python codebase; the former `WVR-007` loader/evaluator waiver has been retired. |
| Security & Supply-Chain | Applies — Event-armed CodeQL, Bandit, pip-audit, gitleaks, zizmor, Dependabot, and Scorecard; all workflow actions are pinned to full commit SHAs and use scoped token permissions. |
| CI/CD | Applies — Pull requests and default-branch pushes run Python, browser, security, and source-integrity gates. GitHub Pages deploys the default branch after merge. Two properties of the `Standards` workflow belong next to this row rather than in a commit message. It is a required check that fetches a **private** repository through a deploy key, and GitHub never passes secrets to a fork run, so a pull request from a fork cannot make it pass; that is a known cost of grading against a private baseline, not a defect to work around. And its pin is a commit rather than a released tag on purpose: `v2.0.0` keys this repository as `permit-pathways`, the checker resolves the entry by checkout basename, and after the GitHub rename that entry no longer matches, so pinning to the tag would fall to the `restricted` publication default and fail the check on an unchanged repository. That PR merged on 2026-09-06, so the pin is now the merge commit on the standards default branch rather than a commit on a PR branch that deletion would make unreachable; re-pinning to a tag still waits on one being cut after it. See issue #74. |
| Observability | N/A — the deployed artifact is a static, no-account, no-telemetry showcase rather than a long-running production service. The proposed no-storage beta runbook still requires host request-metadata and operational-system review because those records sit outside application telemetry. Storage, telemetry, uploads, or external model calls would trigger a new architecture and operational review; the optional AI service directed by ADR 0004 is exactly such a change and will need its own operational review before any hosted deployment. |
| Accessibility | Applies — Axe runs on all five public pages plus populated candidate-route and valid packet states; Lighthouse covers seven public page states. Browser tests also check 320px and 390px reflow, compact mobile navigation, the Spanish handoff language boundary, labeled mobile evidence records, document-level overflow, and the print summary's isolated print-media layout. The versioned human test matrix in `docs/MANUAL-VALIDATION.md` keeps physical-device, virtual-keyboard, keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, forced-colors, printed-output, and Spanish semantic review explicitly `not_run` until signed evidence exists. |
| Internationalization | Applies — `make verify` enforces English/Spanish catalog shape, stable option identifiers, formatter arity, static and formatter placeholders, nonblank singular/plural output, and a copy-leaf pseudo-expansion transform. This is structural automation only: it does not generate or render a complete pseudolocale catalog, and mixed-language acceptance and native Spanish semantic review remain pre-pilot work in `docs/I18N.md`. |
| AI Evaluation | Applies — the offline AI-assisted rule/explanation workflow has model-independent fixtures, and the runtime AI layer (ADR 0004) has a committed bilingual intake evaluation scored on per-field exact match and on abstention versus gap-filling, plus a citation-grounding evaluation counting claims whose quotes verify against the corpus (`evals/ai/`, harness `python -m permit_pathways.ai.eval`). Results are committed only from recorded live runs that name provider, model, date, and commit. Natural-language legal fidelity, applicant comprehension, and Spanish semantic parity remain unreviewed and are not inferred from any of these. |
| Documentation | Applies — Capability status and public claims are maintained in the README, product context, design, demo script, accessibility notes, and ADR log. |
| Quality & Metrics | Applies — Automated evidence includes public Python tests with branch-aware coverage, 29/29 Golden cases, browser checks, and seven Lighthouse page states, plus dependency audits, source-currency output, the exact re-verification worklist, strict non-promoting source-release receipt checks, the deployment-smoke contract, the applicant-copy structural contract, local illustration path/format/size/accessibility checks, the strict workflow-registry boundary, the deterministic evidence-export round trip, adversarial no-storage operations-package checks, the local-source onboarding contract, and the pilot-neutral aggregate beta-gate contract. Browser contracts cover canonical, changed, unrelated, and unverifiable adopted source-state receipts; duplicate-ID, portable-path, raw-registry, and input-fingerprint workflow-registry states; and distinct statewide-coverage, decision-boundary, route-first, collapsed/expanded support, keyboard, reflow, illustration-decoding/tablet-hierarchy, and multi-route accessible-name states. Python registry tests separately inventory canonical directories, reject orphan or linked files, and prove that both the worklist and source-release CLIs bind two distinct registered workflow contexts. Exact current counts and coverage come from CI rather than this prose. The harness reports `automated source/regression checks: pass`; this means those bounded checks passed, not that the law, interpretations, workflow, operating package, source release, local-source intake, aggregate gate, or deployment are approved. The public evidence page exposes the rule-review level: all 19 rules are `machine_linked`, with zero named human reviews or jurisdiction approvals. |
| Performance | Applies — `npm run test:perf` runs Lighthouse against seven public page states and enforces category budgets in `scripts/lighthouse-budget.mjs`; the static pages load no third-party script and the data-driven pages load one generated bundle. Budgets are automated CI evidence on a lab runner, not field measurement from real applicants or devices. |
| AI Development Measurement | Applies — development of this repository is machine-assisted (see `PROVENANCE.md`) and is measured at the portfolio level, not in this repository: there is no repo-local ledger of AI-assisted development metrics, and no claim about development throughput or quality is derived from AI use here. |
| Incident Response | Applies — `SECURITY.md` defines private vulnerability reporting, and `docs/BETA-OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK.md` ("Incident triage") defines roles, severity, containment, rollback, and notification for a future limited beta. The runbook is `prepared_not_approved`: no incident rehearsal has been executed and no role is assigned. |
| Data Governance | Applies — `docs/DATA-FLOW.md` records the no-storage boundary and every data path; `PROVENANCE.md`, `data/sources.json`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` record source origin, retrieval dates, content hashes, and licensing; `docs/EXPORT-RESTORE.md` defines the deterministic public/synthetic evidence export and inert restore. The demo persists no applicant data. CPRA, Information Practices Act, retention, and records-search behavior are designed but not executed or approved. |
| Release & Versioning | N/A — this remains a branch-deployed showcase with no published package, container, action, or signed release. The trigger for replacing this N/A is recorded in `docs/adr/0001-no-versioned-release.md`. |

## How the project check works

1. The applicant selects a jurisdiction and supplies structured project facts.
   When the selection matches the registry, the browser also offers a closed
   native disclosure for that jurisdiction's generated statewide coverage
   profile. It separates the bounded
   statewide candidate-rule inventory from any limited local record, shows the
   dated public HCD history linked in the committed dataset, and lists a
   local-onboarding checklist for a maintainer considering a local layer.
   If a changed source dependency affects the statewide or local inventory,
   that part of the profile is visibly held for source review; an
   unverifiable source remains a warning rather than a change finding.
   The profile is a static orientation aid: it does not look up a parcel,
   retrieve current local materials, determine compliance, or make an approval
   finding.
2. Deterministic criteria match those facts to the bounded rule set. No live
   model and no free-text answer determine eligibility.
3. The browser puts the candidate route before supporting records, then places
   the temporary answers-used receipt and statewide staff handoff in closed
   native disclosures. It also summarizes matching records by group and
   provides jump links. The answers receipt exists only in the current page;
   it is not a stored or exportable applicant record.
4. Result cards keep their consequence, citation, and source-status label
   visible while every longer explanation, next-step, and evidence body starts
   closed. The configured candidate route receives the strongest visual
   treatment; this is hierarchy, not a ranking, recommendation, final route,
   or eligibility finding.
5. Every match includes source status and a citation. When the explanation
   record passes the prototype's schema and fingerprint checks and the source
   evidence is inside its review window, the result can also show a candidate
   consequence, available excerpt, starting steps, and questions for staff.
6. Changing the jurisdiction or any project answer clears the old cover sheet
   and result. The applicant must submit the edited answers to produce a new
   result.
7. Material facts marked "I'm not sure" stop the candidate result and become
   questions for the local planning counter.
8. A stale, unverified, or fingerprint-mismatched source leaves the rule and
   available evidence visible but suppresses action copy and document hints.
9. If complete answers match no encoded route, the app says the bounded rule
   set found no path and routes the applicant generally to local staff.
10. Every recognized city or county receives a bilingual, print-focused
    orientation receipt from the current in-memory result. It preserves the
    selected facts, candidate routes and source status, labels whether a
    bounded local record exists, and supplies questions for local staff. The
    browser handles Print or Save as PDF; the app does not upload or store the
    receipt. It is not a complete local checklist, parcel verification,
    eligibility or completeness finding, or approval prediction.
11. Optionally, before step 1, the applicant can press **Use AI assistance**.
    Only then does the page probe the local AI service; if it answers, a
    free-text field appears and an AI draft of the same structured answers
    is written into the form, each tied to a quote from the description,
    with unanswered questions left as "I'm not sure". After a result, an
    **Explain this result** control asks the service for a labeled
    plain-language explanation whose citations were verified against
    `corpus/`, with the withheld count shown, and for AI-drafted staff
    questions; a follow-up question box answers only from those same cited
    passages or hands back a question for staff. When material facts are
    unknown, only the staff-question draft is offered. The matcher in this
    page is still the only thing that produces the result; the service
    re-runs its own copy and refuses to explain a different rule set.
12. For the active, unedited made-up Woodland sample only, the browser checks
    the generated journey, route, readiness, fingerprint, source-review, and
    strict program-availability contracts. A missing, malformed, or expired
    availability record blocks the handoff. If those checks pass, it asks one
    explicit applicability question. Nothing is preselected: **Yes** exposes
    a future-state packet simulation link, **No** records that the bounded
    workflow does not apply, and **I'm not sure** shows the exact staff
    question. The link contains only the public journey ID and version, not
    project facts, and does not represent a currently listed City plan.

The current app covers statewide ADU, JADU, and SB 9 screening; a generated
coverage profile and bounded orientation handoff are available for all 541
registry entries, while only two jurisdictions have local rule records.
Parcel retrieval, application-file inspection, packet-level completeness,
reviewed remedies, SB 35, AB 2011, reviewed translation, and comprehensive
local rules are planned rather than implemented. The temporary result packet
and coverage profile do not change those boundaries.

## How the bounded packet sample works

1. `data/workflows/registry.json` is the strict path and fingerprint boundary.
   It currently registers exactly one prototype entry and selects it as the
   browser default. Registration does not make the workflow active,
   applicant-ready, reviewed, or jurisdiction-approved.
2. `data/readiness/workflows/woodland-preapproved-detached-adu.json` encodes
   25 requirements from one City of Woodland checklist, source checked
   2026-07-29, for a simulated project that would use a City preapproved
   detached ADU plan. The checklist itself is not presented as inherently
   dated. The official program page was separately checked 2026-08-09 and
   says **“Preapproved ADU List: Coming soon!”**; the sample is not evidence
   that a plan is currently available.
3. `data/readiness/samples/woodland-preapproved-adu.json` supplies one made-up
   project and an explicit inventory status for every requirement. Two
   concrete parcel-fact fixtures are tied to exact fields in the recorded Yolo
   County parcel-layer metadata; the values themselves are fabricated and the
   evaluator does not query a live parcel or inspect a plan, form, or file.
4. `src/permit_pathways/readiness.py` deterministically applies the workflow
   conditions. Missing items remain gaps, unknown facts become staff
   questions, and a changed or stale checklist or parcel-schema source
   prevents a favorable packet summary.
5. `python3 -m permit_pathways.readiness_cli` selects the registered workflow
   by stable ID and prints the machine-readable
   evidence manifest. By default, source age is checked against the current
   UTC date; historical replay requires an explicit `--as-of` date. The build
   uses the same Python evaluator with the sample's recorded date to generate
   `data/readiness/generated/woodland-preapproved-adu-evidence.json` and the
   static bundle.
6. `data/availability/woodland-preapproved-adu-program.json` strictly binds
   the future-state simulation to the official program page, its checked date,
   excerpt fingerprint, status, boundary, and recheck deadline. The browser
   withholds the route-to-packet handoff when this record is missing,
   malformed, or expired; it cannot create a match or establish real-world
   applicability.
7. `data/journeys/woodland-preapproved-detached-adu.json` references the
   golden screening case, candidate route, readiness workflow, packet, and
   applicant-editable applicability fact. `src/permit_pathways/journey.py`
   fails closed unless those records agree, then the build writes
   `data/journeys/generated/woodland-preapproved-detached-adu.json` and embeds
   the same envelope in the static bundle. The envelope emits per-fact
   provenance and the candidate route's recorded source-status date and
   review deadline. The browser independently checks the envelope, its linked
   route and readiness evidence, their fingerprints, current source-review
   windows, and program availability before offering a simulation handoff from
   the canonical sample.
8. The handoff URL contains exactly `journey=<public-id>&version=<version>`.
   It carries no project facts and uses no local storage, session storage, or
   cookies. `prepare.html` withholds packet findings on direct, malformed,
   duplicated, mismatched, stale, or expired-availability entry; a valid
   simulation entry replays and renders the generated Python result. It does
   not contain a second packet evaluator.
9. For that exact valid simulation entry, the page derives a print-focused
   journey summary from the same integrity-checked records. It combines the
   candidate route,
   labeled synthetic facts, exactly three reported-missing preparation
   actions, three staff questions, route/checklist/parcel-metadata evidence,
   the prototype boundary, and journey ID/version. The print control calls the
   browser's native print dialog; the app stores no export. The action block
   remains labeled AI-assisted, review-pending, and not human-reviewed.
   Invalid or direct entry leaves the summary hidden.
10. The checklist mapping and plain-language action copy are AI-assisted
   drafts. They are versioned, fingerprint-bound, and marked
   `prototype_review_pending`; no named human, planner, or Woodland reviewer
   has approved them. A generated content fingerprint detects action-copy
   drift; it is an integrity check, not evidence of human review. Mapping
   metadata binds the exact checklist and
   parcel-schema source digests and records that provider, model, and a
   reproducible run record are unknown or were not retained.
11. No model runs in the readiness CLI, build evaluator, or the packet page.
   The public sample is bundled synthetic data, and the page stores no
   applicant record. (The separate runtime AI service directed by ADR 0004
   serves the project-check page, not this packet sample.)

The sample reports item presence against one checklist and demonstrates
source-shaped parcel evidence with fabricated values. It does not query or
verify a live parcel, inspect file contents, determine legal sufficiency,
certify completeness, limit what staff may request, or predict approval. It
has not been validated with applicants, planners, or a jurisdiction.

## Trust and source currency

The browser and Python demos render explanations from a sidecar that cannot
change the matching result. Each explanation is linked to a stable rule ID,
source date, citation fingerprint, full-rule fingerprint, version, authorship
status, and review status. English and Spanish status are checked
independently.

The deterministic matcher replays 29 structured fixtures against expected rule
IDs. The command-line harness checks selected source hashes and uses explicit
dependency IDs to mark affected rules stale. A completed watcher run can emit
a machine-readable **proposed** snapshot. The scheduled workflow retains that
proposal as an artifact but never rewrites public state. A repository
maintainer must deliberately adopt a completed-run receipt in
`data/source-status/current.json`; the bundle accepts only a strict
`reviewed` receipt and fails closed when its source-registry digest,
observations, or derived rule/Golden impacts drift.

For this receipt, `reviewed` means selected for publication after checking the
run binding. It is not legal, jurisdiction, counsel, or substantive content
approval, and it does not identify a human reviewer. Bundle format 6 carries
the adopted overlay, strict program-availability record, and rule-verification
ledger into the browser. A fetched changed source stales only
exact dependent statewide records and blocks a Woodland route or packet only
when that source is bound to the route, checklist, or parcel metadata. An
unverifiable fetch remains a visible warning and stales nothing. The separate
§ 66321 control is still a temporary rehearsal layered over this committed
state. New-law discovery, automatic adoption, staffed review assignment,
approval history, and automatic publication remain planned.

An unverifiable fetch is recorded by kind, because two very different things
arrive under that one word. A `transport` failure got no authoritative
answer: DNS, TLS, a timeout, a 5xx, throttling, a 403 refusal. A
`not_found` failure means the server answered HTTP 404 or 410 about that
exact address, so the document is no longer published where this project
points. Neither is evidence that the law changed: the retained copy and its
recorded hash still stand, no rule is marked stale, no excerpt or action copy
is suppressed, and no exit code moves. The difference is the link. Where a
rule's own `citation.url` resolves to a `not_found` source, the result card
prints the citation as text instead of an anchor, alongside a sentence saying
the official link did not open, that the quoted text comes from the copy this
project retained, and that staff should be asked for the current document.
`assets/demo.js` and `demo/app.py` derive that from the same committed
receipt and a test asserts they agree; the harness reports the same finding
from the adopted receipt on every run, and the evidence page labels
"published link not found" separately from "could not re-fetch". A watcher
receipt whose unverifiable observation does not say which kind it was is
rejected by the Python loader and by the browser, because a failure the
reader cannot describe honestly is not one to render. The decision, and what
it deliberately does not do, is in
[ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-separate-a-withdrawn-citation-from-an-unreachable-source.md).

The separate readiness tests cover positive, negative, boundary, unknown,
wrong-workflow, changed-source, schema, fingerprint, review-metadata, manifest,
and CLI behavior for the synthetic Woodland packet. These tests establish
bounded software behavior, not checklist completeness, legal accuracy, or
external validation.

## Supporting ordinance screen

The separate ordinance screen checks pasted ordinance or handout text for
selected phrases and patterns documented in an HCD enforcement letter. Against
six quoted provisions from HCD's June 24, 2025 Santa Clara County findings
letter, it reproduces six expected review flags in
`tests/test_conformance.py`.

That fixture runs the Python scanner in `src/permit_pathways/conformance.py`.
The browser page runs a hand-ported JavaScript implementation of the same
checks, so the claim only covers what a visitor runs if the two agree.
`tests/test_conformance_browser_parity.py` executes the shipped
`scanOrdinance()` from `assets/demo.js` under Node against the same fixtures
and requires identical output — check IDs, offsets and excerpt text, not just
the flagged set — and `tests/accessibility.spec.js` asserts that `review.html`
itself renders those flags with the current `checks.json` wording. The two
engines interpret the same check data through different regex implementations
and duplicate the exclusion, context-window and overlap rules by hand, so the
parity test is what keeps a fix or a check edit from landing in one and not
the other.

This is a bounded presence-based screen. It is not a compliance test,
statewide accuracy evaluation, legal interpretation, or proof that required
language is present. Findings point staff or counsel to a candidate provision,
state source, and documented precedent for review.

One committed jurisdiction scan is published under `data/conformance/results/`
and linked from the applicant page. `scripts/scan_ordinances.py` generates it
from the committed ordinance text, copying each matched check's title, state-law
basis and HCD precedent into the result. Because those strings are copies,
`scripts/scan_ordinances.py --check` re-derives every published artifact from
the same corpus and fails when one no longer matches the checks that produced
it; `make bundle-check` runs that gate, so a published result that disagrees
with `data/conformance/checks.json` breaks the build instead of being served.
A published result is point-in-time: it records the date the scan ran, and no
source-currency watch monitors the scanned ordinance for later amendment.

The held-out evaluation contract is implemented as a validated
`status: not_run` planning manifest in
`data/conformance/evaluations/heldout-v1/manifest.json`; the evaluation itself
is still planned. The strict Python interface in
`src/permit_pathways/conformance_evaluation.py` validates the plan, frozen case
set, a key carrying two declared blind reviewer records and adjudication, and
blind predictions; it can
generate blind predictions, score raw pairs, and write a result exclusively
while returning its out-of-band SHA-256. No cases, key, predictions, result,
or run receipt exists. The CLI exposes `validate-plan`; blind `predict` accepts
frozen cases, an output path, timestamp, and declared commit SHA but
intentionally has no answer-key argument. `score` requires the frozen cases,
blind prediction receipt, and key carrying the declared reviewer/adjudication
records. `validate-result` reloads those frozen inputs and the result, then
recomputes the bounded pair outcomes and raw partitions before accepting the
receipt.
Both write paths refuse to overwrite an existing output, return the
whole-artifact SHA-256, and use exit 2 for invalid input or output. The plan
pins the current scanner and nine-check registry, defines the scoring unit as
one `(case_id, check_id)` pair, and permits only
`should_flag`, `should_stay_quiet`, or separately counted
`reference_abstain` reference judgments. Flag and quiet mean only that the
exact passage should enter or stay out of that exact check's review queue;
quiet does not mean conformant. Per active check, the future official corpus
must contain at least one targeted flag pair and one preselected candidate
near-miss quiet pair; incidental findings cannot satisfy that coverage, and
synthetic controls stay separately denominated. Development-source exclusions
carry canonical URLs and retained digests when available. The case-set schema
requires a custodian's near-duplicate-review attestation, while the manifest
fixes the exclusion disposition; semantic overlap review remains external.
Scoring must cover the full case-by-active-check Cartesian
product so unexpected cross-check flags cannot be omitted. Targeted coverage
uses one target check per case; multi-target cases are unsupported in v1. The
six raw counts must remain recomputable overall, per check, and separately for
official and synthetic strata from pair-level observations.
The case set, answer key, blind predictions, result path, evaluator hash, and
all freeze, prediction, and scoring receipts remain null until
official passages are independently collected, fingerprinted, reviewed,
adjudicated, and frozen. A future receipt must record freeze, blind prediction,
answer-key unblinding, and scoring in that order. Unblinding retires that
corpus for future scanner versions; any post-run tuning needs a newly selected
corpus. The binary scanner has no machine-abstention output; an execution error
must fail rather than become an abstention. A future result must bind every
input digest internally; its whole-artifact SHA-256 is recorded out of band
because the result cannot contain its own byte hash. The result binds the
manifest digest directly. Receipt commit SHAs are
recorded bindings; this interface does not retrieve or authenticate Git
objects. Until that external work and a bound run exist, there are no held-out
precision, recall, accuracy, or statewide-coverage results to report.

## Showcase scenario mapping

| Scenario | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Scenario 1 (A): guiding applicants to a complete, well-routed application | Primary prototype. Candidate ADU, JADU, and SB 9 routing, a temporary grouped result packet, citations, uncertainty routing, and one generated synthetic Woodland packet-presence future-state simulation are implemented. The official program page currently says its preapproved plan list is coming soon, so this is not an applicant-ready workflow. The sample uses 25 source-bound checklist requirements, two fabricated values tied to official parcel-layer fields, and review-pending AI-assisted action drafts. Live parcel retrieval, file inspection, parcel-specific packet completeness, reviewed remedies, and reviewed translation are planned. |
| Scenario 2 (B): supporting internal review | Not targeted in v1. |
| Scenario 3 (C): keeping current with housing law | Prototype assurance layer beneath Scenario 1. Selected-source checking, proposed run receipts, deliberate snapshot adoption, exact rule/Golden and bounded packet-context worklists, applicant-output invalidation, separate fingerprint-bound decision templates, strict `not_run` approval/publication/rollback receipt tooling, and an HCD-letter dataset are implemented in bounded form. A read-only comparable-jurisdiction precedent CLI (`permit_pathways.precedent`) groups the committed 1,312-letter HCD snapshot by letter kind and authority so a reader can find documented precedent; it makes no compliance finding and fetches nothing. Search, new-law discovery, automatic adoption/publication, completed staffed assignments or receipts, and substantive approval history are planned. |

## Design commitments (from the challenge statement's cross-cutting requirements)

- Decision support, never a legal agent; abstention over confabulation.
- Rules, sources, cases, and review artifacts use portable files. A pinned,
  deterministic ZIP can export and restore-verify either the frozen 58-file
  schema-v1 compatibility set or the current 59-file, registry-aware schema-v2
  public and synthetic evidence set without vendor-only storage. The held-out
  evaluation planning artifact, beta-operations ADR/runbook/ledger/tooling,
  source-change release-receipt templates, pilot-neutral aggregate gate and
  validator, and any future cases, answer key, execution receipt, approval, or
  result are
  outside export profiles v1 and v2 and require a separately reviewed future
  profile version. This is not a production applicant-data export,
  contractual ownership/offboarding,
  partner acceptance, backup, or CPRA workflow. This prototype has no
  accounts, uploads, or applicant-data store.
- A proposed beta operations package documents the current
  no-application-storage boundary, deployment inventory, retention/deletion,
  CPRA routing, incident, support, release, and rollback procedures. Every
  deployment-specific approval and rehearsal remains null/`not_run`; it does
  not establish CPRA, Information Practices Act, SAM, or SIMM compliance. Any
  applicant-data flow would require a superseding architecture and review.
- Dependency-light and designed to sit alongside existing permitting systems.
  Pilot integration, staffing, hosting, and cost evidence remain planned.
- WCAG 2.2 AAA target with a static computed-contrast audit
  (`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`); required human/assistive-technology checks remain
  open. English/Spanish intake, interface controls, and plain-language result
  drafts are prototyped. Spanish drafts have no human or semantic-parity
  review. Applicant-facing result titles are localized drafts; canonical
  source citations, excerpts, and generic document hints remain English.
  All five public pages load a locally maintained California Design System
  version-0 preview compatibility layer before product styles. It applies
  selected semantic `ca-*` structures, published California tokens, and local
  Public Sans webfonts while keeping decision/evidence records and the service
  header product-specific. The successor system is pre-Alpha with no
  production-supported release, so commit `f8775cf` is a design reference
  only: no successor package, source, or compiled bundle is vendored. This is
  component alignment, not conformance, certification, State branding,
  affiliation, or endorsement. The optional Python-rendered reference flow
  loads the same two style assets and uses the same component hooks instead of
  maintaining a separate visual system. See `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`.

## Status

Working prototype. The statewide rule base covers ADU, JADU, and both SB 9
pathways, encoded from the **March 2026 HCD ADU Handbook** and the **April
2026 HCD SB 9 fact sheet** (both in `corpus/hcd/`), each rule carrying the
recorded supporting excerpt and a `verified_on` date.
Machine-assisted encoding. A documented human spot-check against the PDFs in
`corpus/hcd/` is the intended next verification pass. In the current schema,
`verified_on` means dated source evidence is recorded; it does not mean a
jurisdiction, counsel, or named human reviewer approved the interpretation.
The separate plain-language layer records its own version, linked rule-source
date, citation fingerprint, full-rule fingerprint, AI-assisted authorship, and
pending review status. Review metadata is bound to the explanation version it
covered. If browser-side fingerprint validation is unavailable, the display
fails closed to matched rules and evidence without explanation copy. All 19
current rule records have English and Spanish drafts; none is represented as
human-reviewed or jurisdiction-approved.

A separate rule-verification ledger, now schema version 2
(`src/permit_pathways/rule_verification.py`,
`data/validation/rule-verification.json`) adds an explicit `machine_linked` /
`human_reviewed` / `jurisdiction_approved` level on top of the bare
`verified_on` date. Every current rule is recorded `machine_linked`; a
promoted level must bind both the exact citation fingerprint and the exact
full-rule fingerprint. A changed dependency, aged source evidence, aged
review, or fingerprint drift demotes the effective claim to `machine_linked`
rather than keeping a stronger claim alive. No rule has an actual named
reviewer or jurisdiction sign-off yet. `python -m permit_pathways.harness`
prints `automated source/regression checks: pass` when its bounded checks pass
and reports the effective level counts. The public evidence page exposes the
same coverage: all 19 current rules are `machine_linked`, with zero named
reviews and zero jurisdiction approvals. Neither surface can change which
rules match an intake or promote a claim.

The separate Woodland readiness workflow is also machine-assisted and is
explicitly a future-state simulation because the official program page says
no preapproved plan list is available yet. Its 25
checklist mappings, two parcel-field bindings, and action drafts have
automated schema, coverage, source, and fingerprint checks, but remain
review-pending. The parcel values are fabricated and do not represent a query
or verified parcel. Mapping metadata explicitly records the absence of
retained provider, model, and run details. The generated synthetic packet
result has not been reviewed or validated by an applicant, planner, Woodland
staff member, counsel, or another jurisdiction representative.

A period detail that demonstrates the currency problem: state ADU law was
renumbered from
Gov. Code § 65852.2 et seq. to §§ 66310–66342 by SB 477 (2024), with further
renumbering in 2025 legislation. Any tool that cited the old sections, as
this repo's own first-day placeholder did, has exactly the staleness the
harness is built to catch. (HCD's own first finding against Santa Clara
County's ordinance was this renumbering; see the conformance scanner below.)

## Transit-proximity determinations (GTFS)

Two ADU standards turn on transit proximity, and both are computable from a
jurisdiction's GTFS feed instead of applicant self-attestation: the
§ 66322(a)(1) parking exemption (half-mile walking distance of public
transit) and the § 66321(b)(4)(B) 18-ft height allowance (half-mile of a
major transit stop, PRC § 21064.3, or a high-quality transit corridor,
PRC § 21155(b), both requiring peak-headway analysis). `transit.py` parses
the feed, measures worst peak-window gaps per stop/route, clusters corner
stops into intersections, and returns screening results over the supplied
datasets. Straight-line distance can eliminate a supplied stop, but it cannot
establish that every relevant operator, stop, or service record is present.

Run against the bundled summer Unitrans (Davis) feed on 2026-08-04, no local
bus stops meet the encoded ≤15/≤20-minute peak screens. The separate statewide
high-quality transit dataset supplies the Davis Amtrak major-stop candidate
near the depot. That disagreement is the useful finding: a local feed alone is
incomplete, and multiple operators and walking distance still need explicit
confirmation before applicant-facing use.

**A headway is a fact about a date.** `--as-of` is required for any headway
conclusion, and there is deliberately no default to today, so a recorded run
stays reproducible. Only the services `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`
put on that date are measured, and the date is checked against the validity
window in `feed_info.txt`. The bundled Unitrans feed makes the difference
concrete: it declares itself valid 2026-07-20 to 2026-09-22 and ships two
disjoint session calendars, so 2026-08-04 measures service `71` across
sixteen routes and 2026-08-09 measures service `79` across two, while
2026-09-07 — a Monday — runs `79` because `calendar_dates.txt` removes `71`
and adds `79` for Labor Day.

Before this, `transit.py` read `calendar.txt` alone, kept whichever
`service_id` had the most trips, and never opened `feed_info.txt` or
`calendar_dates.txt`. A summer session, a holiday, and a feed that expired
years ago all produced a headway, and which headway depended on which of the
feed's service periods happened to be larger. Four states now withhold rather
than answer, and each reports `unknown` — never "no qualifying stop", because
a feed that could not be read has not found an absence:

| state | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `no_as_of` | no service date was supplied |
| `outside_feed_window` | the date falls outside the feed's own validity window |
| `no_calendar` | the feed ships neither calendar file |
| `no_service_on_date` | the calendar is readable and says nothing runs — the one negative a feed *can* support |

A candidate resting on the statewide Caltrans dataset is unaffected, because
that dataset carries its own currency and is not scoped by a local feed's
calendar. `frequencies.txt` is not expanded; a feed that ships one is
reported as such rather than measured around.

**A planned stop is not an existing one.** The statewide Caltrans dataset
carries an `hqta_details` column that separates a stop derived from published
service from one an MPO submitted as planned in its adopted regional
transportation plan. 3,120 of the 13,446 distinct `major_stop_*` rows the
loader returns from the committed snapshot are planned, close to one row in
four. Cal-ITP's published methodology lists them under "Planned Major Stops
(future service, provided by MPOs)" and says Caltrans
"does not validate or further process them"; the same document quotes
PRC § 21155 including regional-transportation-plan stops in its own
major-transit-stop definition, and PRC § 21064.3(a) requiring "An existing
rail or bus rapid transit station". The screen reads that column. A planned
row never produces a candidate and never establishes public transit near the
site, and every planned row inside the half mile is reported by count,
agency, type, and distance with a question for the transit agency. The
command above previously named a planned Yolo TD stop 0.12 mi away as the
reason the 18-ft allowance applied, in the present tense; it now names the
operating Capitol Corridor rail platform at 0.36 mi and lists the twelve
planned rows separately. This module does not decide which statutory
definition a given standard incorporates; it refuses to collapse the two.
See [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-planned-transit-stops-are-not-existing-ones.md).

**Jurisdiction registry:** 541 California jurisdictions (483 incorporated
cities + 58 counties) are selectable. The original Census 2020 FIPS snapshot
is supplemented with [Mountain House](https://www.mountainhouseca.gov/27/Government),
incorporated in 2024. The same statewide candidate-rule set can be screened
for each registry entry; that is not a claim that its local code, parcel
facts, forms, or exceptions are encoded. The two local metadata records
(Davis and Woodland) are labeled separately, and neither represents
comprehensive local-code coverage.

**Statewide Coverage Navigator:** selecting a recognized registry entry shows
a generated profile from
[`data/jurisdictions/generated/coverage-index.json`](data/jurisdictions/generated/coverage-index.json).
It keeps three facts separate: the same bounded statewide candidate-rule set
is available for every registry entry; only the limited local records already
encoded in the repository are local coverage; and the linked public HCD
Housing Accountability Unit history is a dated dataset reference, not a
current compliance result. A profile with no local record means Permit
Bearings has not encoded one — it does not mean local requirements do not
exist. A profile with no linked HCD record means none was linked in the
committed dataset — it does not prove no HCD activity, compliance, or complete
coverage. The profile also lists a local-onboarding checklist for a maintainer
considering a local layer: operative ordinance sections and effective dates;
current forms, checklists, fees, and process pages; official URLs with
source-check dates and content fingerprints; project/parcel scope, exceptions,
and unresolved questions; plus accountable owner-role IDs and a re-verification
cadence. A source link alone never creates a local rule.

That checklist now has a separate, machine-testable offline intake contract at
[`data/onboarding/local-source-intake-template.json`](data/onboarding/local-source-intake-template.json).
The read-only validator accepts an empty `not_run` template, an in-progress
collection, or a complete `prepared_for_review` package. It strictly binds the
five source roles, source IDs/HTTPS URLs/fingerprints/check dates, operative
passage text and enactment/effective/check dates, project/parcel scope,
candidate exceptions, unresolved conflicts, open questions, and planned
accountable owner-role IDs/cadence. It binds every operative passage to the
declared ordinance role, rejects noncanonical metadata and malformed URLs,
and limits UTF-8 JSON input to 1 MiB. Historical CLI replay never reports
current readiness and emits its validation date and earliest recheck date. It
never accepts a reviewed, approved, encoded, or published
state, cannot change matching, and does not authenticate a publisher or create
a real local layer. The committed template contains no jurisdiction or source
data and all owner, cadence, review, and approval fields remain null/`not_run`.
It is outside evidence export profiles v1 and v2; a filled partner copy needs a
separate data-classification and export decision.

A changed dependency in the adopted source-state receipt visibly places its
affected statewide inventory and any affected local source record on a
source-review hold. The raw citation remains available as evidence, but the
profile does not describe that inventory as ready to screen or use for
coverage until it is re-verified. An unreachable source remains a distinct
warning and does not create that hold.

The rule base currently covers, statewide: ADU ministerial review and the
15-business-day/60-day clocks, protected minimum unit, size allowances,
height allowances, parking limits and exemptions, the owner-occupancy
prohibition, conversion exemptions, pre-2020 unpermitted-unit legalization,
multifamily-lot 66323 allowances, JADU standards, SB 9 two-unit developments,
SB 9 urban lot splits, and the SB 9 × ADU unit-count interaction, plus
bounded local metadata records for the Cities of Davis and Woodland. A weekly
GitHub Action re-fetches selected statewide sources and classifies each as
unchanged, changed, or unverifiable. It opens a review issue when a fetched
source's content hash moved, a rule aged out, or a Golden scenario regressed;
a source it could not download is recorded as unverifiable with its last
successful verification date and marks no rule stale.

That alert converges rather than accumulating. Titles are stable and carry no
run date, so an unresolved condition produces one issue and weekly comments on
it rather than a new issue every Monday. Both alerts carry a `currency` label,
each repeat comment says how many days the condition has been open, and a
green run closes what it opened with a comment naming the run that cleared it.
An unverifiable run neither opens nor closes anything, because nothing was
learned about the law in it. The harness prints one machine-readable
`currency signals:` line on every run, including a clean one, so the issue can
say which of the three conditions fired: a changed source hash, an aged-out
rule, and a Golden regression have different owners and different urgency. Two
selected Woodland workflow
sources, the January 2026 Davis ADU handout, and HCD's October 2025 Davis
technical-assistance letter are recorded and watched. The Davis record reports
only the City's published processing categories; it preserves HCD's unresolved
ordinance-status warning and does not determine which category lawfully
applies. Comprehensive local-source and newly enacted-law discovery are not
implemented. Each scheduled run also retains a proposed source-state receipt.
The public build uses only the separately adopted receipt; it is a dated
snapshot, not a live per-page check or an automatic legal update.
When a review-needed watcher receipt includes at least one fetched source whose
content changed, the same job also retains a 30-day `source-review-package`
artifact containing the proposed receipt, an exact schema-v2 worklist, and a
blank fingerprint-bound decision template. Stale-rule-only and Golden-
regression-only runs still open the currency-review issue, but do not produce a
misleading source-change package. Changed checklist, parcel-field, rule,
Golden-case, remedy, packet, and configured journey effects follow explicit
IDs. Golden fixtures carry explicit `rule_dependency_ids`, including negative
and ambiguous expected-empty cases. Unverifiable sources create no work. The
artifact does not select an owner, complete review, adopt the proposal, clear
a hold, promote verification, or publish a replacement.

The full static showcase has five task-focused pages: an applicant-first
landing page; an English/Spanish applicant guide with review clocks; the
gated generated synthetic packet-presence sample; a bounded ordinance screen;
and an evidence-and-updates page. Project-specific local illustrations give the
landing and project-check introductions a visual anchor without adding a new
step or evidentiary claim; the project-check illustration is removed at
narrower breakpoints so the form stays primary. On a recognized jurisdiction selection, the
applicant guide offers the Statewide Coverage Navigator in a closed native
disclosure: a static profile of the bounded statewide inventory,
limited-local-layer status, dated public HCD history, and local-onboarding
requirements. A submitted result renders a dynamic grouped summary with jump
links, an always-visible decision boundary, and the visually primary candidate
route before supporting records. Every longer rule body starts closed; the
temporary answers-used receipt and statewide handoff follow in closed native
disclosures.
The boundary distinguishes candidate, unresolved-fact, no-route-in-the-bounded
corpus, and source-review-hold states; every candidate card also retains the
exact route-record name. Citations and source-status badges stay visible
outside the disclosures. Ordinary answer edits clear the old result until the
applicant submits again. Every recognized jurisdiction also receives a
bilingual print-focused orientation receipt derived from the current page:
facts used, candidate-route sources and currency, local-coverage status, and
questions for staff. Printing or saving is browser-owned and the app stores no
receipt. The applicant guide also includes plain-language
explanation drafts and an abstention path ("needs staff review") when no
encoded state pathway matches. Spanish explanation copy is an unreviewed
machine draft; applicant-facing titles are localized drafts while canonical
pathway labels, excerpts, citations, and document hints remain English when
shown. Stale and unverified records suppress action copy, interpretive notes,
and document hints. For the canonical active, unedited Woodland sample, an
explicit applicability answer can open the versioned packet step; all other
entry states fail closed. The packet page renders a Python-generated result
and links its evidence manifest. The same exact valid entry presents a
print-focused summary of the integrity-checked route, made-up facts, first
three preparation actions, staff questions, evidence sources, boundary, and
journey ID/version; its button delegates Print or Save as PDF to the browser
without creating an app-side export. The evidence page includes a clearly
labeled one-click rehearsal of an amendment to Gov. Code § 66321; matching
applicant records can be opened in the stale state, but the rehearsal is not
persisted production state. The smaller Python reference demo renders the same
explanation sidecar and keeps a separate `/trust` route.

## Layout

- `src/permit_pathways/screening.py`: deterministic pathway-screening engine
- `src/permit_pathways/explanations.py`: versioned explanation validation
- `src/permit_pathways/readiness.py`: deterministic bounded packet-presence
  evaluator and evidence-manifest generator
- `src/permit_pathways/readiness_cli.py`: packet-presence CLI
- `src/permit_pathways/journey.py`: strict versioned route-to-packet contract
  resolver for the synthetic Woodland fixture
- `src/permit_pathways/workflow_registry.py`: strict portable workflow,
  packet, journey, availability, and generated-output path registry with
  canonical-input raw-byte pins and complete artifact inventory checks
- `src/permit_pathways/program_availability.py`: strict, date-bound Woodland
  policy plus a conservative generic prototype policy whose exact negative
  excerpt, source/program IDs, canonical HTTPS program path, and fingerprint
  must agree; both are isolated from screening/readiness
- `src/permit_pathways/source_state.py`: strict watcher-receipt validation,
  exact rule/Golden dependency impact, and the withdrawn-citation derivation
  that names each rule whose printed citation address answered "not found"
- `src/permit_pathways/review_queue.py` and `review_queue_cli.py`: portable,
  fingerprint-bound source-change worklists and separate human decision
  ledgers that cannot clear holds or republish output
- `src/permit_pathways/local_source_onboarding.py` and
  `local_source_onboarding_cli.py`: strict read-only validation for a portable
  local-source intake whose maximum state is `prepared_for_review`
- `src/permit_pathways/source_release.py` and `source_release_cli.py`: strict,
  read-only approval, publication, and rollback receipt contracts bound to the
  exact source snapshot, worklist, decision ledger, upstream receipt, and
  separately reviewed publication/restoration source states; committed
  templates keep every evidence field null and remain `not_run`
- `src/permit_pathways/deployment_smoke.py`: read-only public-route and
  generated-coverage-index deployment check
- `src/permit_pathways/conformance_evaluation.py`: strict `not_run` manifest
  validation and future frozen-case, blind-prediction, adjudication, and raw
  scoring contracts for the presence-based scanner
- `src/permit_pathways/conformance_evaluation_cli.py`: `validate-plan`, blind
  `predict`, declared-reviewer-key `score`, and recomputing `validate-result`
  commands with exclusive prediction/result writes
- `src/permit_pathways/evidence_export.py` and `evidence_export_cli.py`:
  deterministic, Git-bound public/synthetic evidence packaging, verification,
  and inert restore
- `src/permit_pathways/beta_operations.py`: strict validator/CLI for the
  pilot-neutral `prepared_not_approved` operating ledger; it rejects filled
  deployment, approval, rehearsal, and receipt fields
- `src/permit_pathways/beta_gate.py` and `beta_gate_cli.py`:
  canonical-path/raw-digest-bound pilot-neutral aggregate that validates one
  immutable repository snapshot, current currency, and 14 conservative beta
  exit categories while accepting only `prepared` / `not_run`. `validate` is
  read-only; `recompute` re-derives the digests an ordinary source refresh
  moves, taking every derived value from the validator, refusing the immutable
  not-run ledgers, and reporting rather than editing the one anchor that lives
  in Python source
- `src/permit_pathways/rule_verification.py`: schema-v2
  machine-linked/human-reviewed/jurisdiction-approved claim evaluation for
  rule citations and full-rule records
- `src/permit_pathways/ai/`: the optional runtime AI service (ADR 0004):
  fact vocabulary, corpus text index and citation verifier, lexical
  retrieval, provider adapter over the public `anthropic` SDK, intake
  extraction, grounded explanation, staff-question drafting, the FastAPI
  app, the evaluation harness, and the ordinance-to-rule drafting CLI
  whose output can only land in Git-ignored `ai-drafts/`; `assets/ai.js`
  is its browser side
- `evals/ai/`: committed intake and grounding cases, results of recorded
  live runs, and the scoring contract
- `deploy/ai-service/`: prepared AWS Lambda deployment of the AI service
  with a hard daily request cap (Terraform; prototype showcase shape, not
  the reviewed beta)
- `src/permit_pathways/harness/`: verification runner and CLI
- `data/rules/`: the cited rule base; `data/golden/`: Golden cases with
  explicit positive and negative rule-dependency IDs
- `data/conformance/evaluations/heldout-v1/manifest.json`: validated
  `not_run` contract for a future independently frozen scanner evaluation;
  no cases, answer key, blind predictions, execution, or result is recorded
- `data/explanations/plain-language.json`: English/Spanish explanation drafts
- `data/validation/rule-verification.json`: the rule verification-level
  ledger; every current entry is `machine_linked`
- `data/validation/beta-operations-readiness.json`: portable 17-control,
  nine-approval no-storage beta plan; all execution and approval evidence is
  null/`not_run`
- `data/onboarding/local-source-intake-template.json`: generic `not_run`
  local-source collection template with no jurisdiction, source, owner,
  review, or approval evidence
- `data/validation/pilot-beta-gate.json`: strict aggregate planning record;
  pilot scope is empty, all 14 exit categories are `not_run`, and the current
  Woodland artifacts are bound only as a synthetic prototype reference
- `data/availability/woodland-preapproved-adu-program.json`: official-page
  evidence and recheck boundary for the future-state Woodland simulation
- `data/workflows/registry.json`: one registered prototype workflow and the
  explicit browser-default selection; it does not record multiple active
  workflows
- `data/readiness/`: the Woodland workflow, synthetic packet, review-pending
  remedies, and generated evidence manifest
- `data/journeys/`: the reference-only Woodland journey definition and its
  generated fingerprinted envelope
- `data/source-status/current.json`: repository-adopted completed-run receipt
  used as the public source-state overlay
- `data/export/public-synthetic-evidence-v1.json`: exact artifact membership,
  raw digest pins, public-state assertions, exclusions, and known absences for
  the frozen 58-file schema-v1 compatibility handoff
- `data/export/public-synthetic-evidence-v2.json`: current 59-file profile that
  adds registry-aware closure and advances the existing bundle pin to format 6
- `data/jurisdictions/generated/coverage-index.json`: generated statewide
  coverage profiles that keep the statewide inventory, limited local records,
  dated HCD history, and local-onboarding boundary distinct

  jurisdiction-coverage index used by the browser profile
- `src/permit_pathways/precedent.py`: read-only comparable-jurisdiction
  discovery over the committed HCD letter snapshot; groups by letter kind and
  authority, fetches nothing, writes nothing, and carries its
