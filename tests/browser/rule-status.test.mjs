/**
 * The browser's staleness rule and withdrawn-citation derivation, unit tested
 * against the shipped file.
 *
 * `ruleStatus()` decides whether a result card shows action copy or withholds
 * it. `citationLinkNotFound()` decides whether a citation is printed as a
 * link or as text (ADR 0005). Both are duplicated between `assets/demo.js`,
 * `demo/app.py`, and the Python harness. `tests/test_source_review_window.py`
 * already pins the 180-day constant across all four; these tests pin the
 * behaviour built on top of it, in the runtime a visitor actually runs.
