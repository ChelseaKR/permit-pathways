"""Offline tests for the HCD HAU letters drift check.

Two dated issues (#63, #65) reported the same condition with the same
numbers, `dashboard rows: 1317; committed rows: 1314; CHANGED`. Three is the
difference between two row totals, not a count of new letters: HCD edits
published rows in place, so the same run can add rows, remove rows, and edit
rows, and the totals hide all of it. These tests pin the distinctions the
report has to keep, and the one it must never make — reporting an
unreachable dashboard as a change.

No test here touches the network.
