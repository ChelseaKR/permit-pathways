"""A citation whose published address is gone is its own finding.

The watcher already refuses to call an unreachable source "changed". These
tests hold the line one level down: a fetch that got *no answer* and a
fetch whose answer was "no document is published here" are different
findings with different owners, and only the second one means the link this
project prints beside a rule resolves to nothing for a reader.

Nothing here may make a rule stale. That invariant is asserted directly.
