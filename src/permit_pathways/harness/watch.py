"""Source currency watcher.

Re-fetches every watched source document and compares its content hash to
the hash recorded when rules were last verified. Each watched source lands
in exactly one of three states:

* ``unchanged`` — fetched, and the hash still matches the recorded one.
* ``changed``   — fetched, and the hash differs. The source has been
  revised; every rule citing it must be treated as stale until a person
  re-verifies the rule against the new text.
* ``unverifiable`` — the fetch itself failed. This is *not* evidence about
  the content. The recorded hash and the last successful verification date
  still stand, so dependent rules keep whatever status their own review
  dates give them and are never marked stale by a failed download.

Conflating the third state with the second is what this module exists to
avoid: a runner that gets rate-limited would otherwise report every
statewide source as "changed" and flip every dependent rule to stale.
Fetch failures are still reported, never swallowed — they are just
reported as what they are.

The same argument applies once more *inside* ``unverifiable``, so every
failure also carries a ``kind``:

* ``transport`` — no authoritative answer arrived. DNS, TLS, timeout,
  connection reset, 5xx, throttling, a bot/WAF block. It says nothing
  about the document or its address.
* ``not_found`` — the server answered, and its answer was that the
  document is not at that address (HTTP 404 or 410). That is still not
  evidence that the law changed, and the retained copy and its recorded
  hash still stand. It *is* evidence about the published address: the
  citation this project prints for applicants no longer resolves, so a
  reader who follows it gets nothing. Retrying an authoritative answer is
  waste, so ``not_found`` short-circuits the retry budget.

Reporting the two together is how a local certificate-store failure and a
withdrawn city handout end up looking identical in a run summary. They are
not the same finding and they have different owners.
