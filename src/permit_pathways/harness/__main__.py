"""Run the verification harness from the command line.

    python -m permit_pathways.harness
    python -m permit_pathways.harness --assume-changed "ca-gov-66321"

--assume-changed marks one stable source ID as changed, e.g. to rehearse what
a legislative amendment does to the rule base: every explicitly dependent
rule flips to stale until re-verified.

Exit codes:

* ``0`` — the bounded automated source-age and structured-regression checks
  pass. This is not a human-review or legal-accuracy result.
* ``1`` — review needed: a watched source's content changed, a rule aged
  out of its review window, or a golden case regressed.
* ``2`` — one or more watched sources could not be re-fetched. Nothing is
  known to be wrong with the rule base; the check simply could not confirm
  currency for those sources this run. Kept distinct from ``1`` so a
  blocked or rate-limited runner cannot masquerade as a legislative change.

An unverifiable source is reported by kind. A ``transport`` failure got no
answer and is a fact about this run. A ``not_found`` failure means the
server answered that no document is published at that address, so a rule
citing it prints a link that resolves to nothing. Neither stales a rule and
neither changes the exit code: a withdrawn link is a publication fact the
maintainer may not be able to fix in the same run, so it is reported
loudly rather than used to break the build.

The machine-readable ``currency signals:`` line reports ``changed_sources``
and ``unverifiable_sources`` as ``not_checked`` unless ``--fetch`` was given.
Both are answers only a download can produce, and a run that downloaded
nothing has not earned the number ``0`` for either.
